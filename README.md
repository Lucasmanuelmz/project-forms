# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Sign-Up Form Project

This is a sign-up form project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, specifically in the intermediate Node.js path.

The form should include fields for first name, last name, email address, phone number, password, and password confirmation. Additionally, it's important to implement basic validations on the form fields, such as ensuring that no required field is left blank, that passwords match, and other relevant validations.
